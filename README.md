`Automation`


-----
I first got a very simple mission: 
> A fictitious company called XYZ, is a luxurious cars reseller. The CEO wanted to know how was the company's sales since 2012 (when his company started in Brazil). With that in mind he sent me this spreadsheet and gave me tasks that the automation needed: [VendaCarros.xlsx](https://github.com/jotamath/automaticemail/files/13768702/VendaCarros.xlsx)
- A new spreadsheet with just Fabricant, PriceTag and Year. With Year being the new Index;
- Create a 'Total Sales per Fabricant' row at the end;
- Build a graphic using this new data;
- Send this new spreadsheet to his email.
------
The final result was [test.xlsx](https://github.com/jotamath/automaticemail/files/13768739/test.xlsx)
and after that I sent him an automatic email using Python as well.
